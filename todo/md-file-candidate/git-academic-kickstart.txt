Once you have created your Github account and setup Git on your computer, we will create two new repositories (often abbreviated as repos) on Github with the following names:

academic-kickstart or any other name you like - we will save your content to this repo
<USERNAME>.github.io where <USERNAME> is your Github username - we will save the generated website to this repo
==
chaos repo -- content/ of hugo tree
dyiwu.github.io repo -- save the generated website to this repo -- public/

===
To create the academic-kickstart repository, fork the Academic Kickstart repository and clone your fork with Git (download it to your computer) by replacing <USERNAME> in the following command with your Github username:

git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git chaos
git clone https://github.com/dyiwu/academic-kickstart.git chaos
cd chaos
git submodule update --init --recursive
===
In your config.toml file, set baseurl = "https://<USERNAME>.github.io/", where <USERNAME> is your Github username. Stop Hugo if it’s running and delete the public directory if it exists (by typing rm -r public/).

Add your .github.io repository into a submodule in a folder named public, replacing with your Github username:

git submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/dyiwu/dyiwu.github.io.git public

===
Add everything to your local git repository and push it up to your remote repository on GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master

=======
Next, regenerate your website’s HTML code by running Hugo and uploading the public submodule to GitHub:

hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Build website"
git push origin master
cd ..

======
